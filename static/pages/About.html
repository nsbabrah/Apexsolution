			<p  >We started in Winnipeg in 1951 as a productivity improvement company by outsourcing talent in a new way—by charging our clients based on what our people were actually able to produce. That’s really how Drake’s temporary staffing evolved. We provided workers for the purpose of completing a specific job within a certain amount of time for a company instead of hiring people full-time. That way, we matched our client’s workforce to their workload—that is, during the fluctuations of slow and busy periods, they never had workers being paid to do nothing and they’re never short-handed either.</p><br></br>

				<p> Since then, our company has evolved into permanent recruitment as well, and is also working with clients to increase the productivity of their people by providing a range of performance enhancement solutions. What we found was that our clients were facing other challenges, and it wasn’t just people that were the solution. Often the solution was a consulting service. It was helping develop their leaders or building stronger teams, and so we started to assess how to better put the right people in those positions.

				Over the last ten years our solutions have gone one step further. Everything we do still supports productivity improvement, but now a company can outsource their entire HR department to us, saving themselves the administratively heavy tasks of payroll, benefits admin, and workplace health and safety. We can design onboarding and orientation programs, surveys, exit interviews… really anything where the “people side” of the business is concerned, Drake has solutions that can help.</p></section>
